				The Magic 8-Ball is a plastic sphere made to look like an eight-ball, 
				that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. 
				It was first invented in 1950 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman, 
				and is currently manufactured by Mattel. 
				The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the large ball, 
				then turns it over to expose a written answer in a window on the ball.
